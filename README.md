# BLINK

**BLINK** is a program with two main features.

1. It creates an audio interface between an input and an output, with the ability to process sound in real-time in between. For instance, examples of delay, reverb, and saturation effects have been implemented.

2. The second and primary purpose is to transform a polyphonic input signal into data representing only the frequencies being played. This allows for identifying, at any given moment, the notes being played, and subsequently recreating an artificial signal composed of pure tones corresponding to the input signal.
